                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>
                    Northwest Treks (NWT) is applying for a highly competitive four-day backpacking permit in the Enchantments for 2025 to create a promotional video. Given the strict lottery-based application process, NWT needs data-driven insights to maximize their chances of securing a permit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team's objective is to analyze historical lottery statistics and weather data to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Estimate NWT’s probability of winning a permit based on 2024 results.</li>
                    <li>Identify application strategies—such as optimal entry dates, preferred zones, and party sizes—to improve their chances.</li>
                    <li>Recommend the best entry date for visiting the Core Zone under favorable weather conditions (average temperature >52°F and rainfall <0.03”).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    By leveraging data storytelling, clear visualizations, and strategic recommendations, we aim to help NWT make informed decisions and increase their likelihood of a successful application.

                <h2>Goal/Key Metrics</h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the Enchantments permit deadline passing after the assignment submission, the professor was unable to test our recommendations in a real application. Therefore, our primary goal was to deliver a compelling and data-driven presentation that effectively communicated our insights, impressed the professor, and engaged the class.
                </p>
                <h2>Actions</h2>
                <p>
                    Each team member had a defined role in the presentation, allowing us to focus on our individual strengths. With my technical expertise, I took on the task of forecasting weather conditions using Python, rather than relying solely on historical averages—ensuring more reliable predictions given the impact of climate change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Leveraging my experience in PowerPoint design (see the Entrepreneurial Project in this portfolio), I created a visually engaging presentation that complemented our storytelling. After a sleepless night recording Tableau animations, our final presentation was polished and impactful. The result? We received the highest grade our professor had ever given, and our classmates were thoroughly impressed with our visualizations.
                </p>

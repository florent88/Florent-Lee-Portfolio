                <p>
                    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping industries, and software development is no exception. With the rise of generative AI, the boundaries of what machines can achieve are expanding rapidly, presenting both opportunities and challenges for developers. Yet, how does this transformative technology impact the traditional phases of software development â€” from client requirements to deployment and maintenance?
                </p>
                <p>
                    This memoir explores the short and medium-term effects of AI, particularly generative AI, on the software development lifecycle. By combining a literature review with hands-on demonstrations. The study simulates a real-world development project, leveraging generative AI tools to execute tasks traditionally handled by humans. The objective is not just to evaluate AI's technical capabilities but to critically analyze its potential to revolutionize each step of the process, from ideation to delivery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through this exploration, I went into the limits, possibilities, and implications of integrating AI into software development, offering a forward-looking perspective on its role in shaping the future of the profession.

                <p>
                    This project sought to explore how generative AI could support software development by assessing its applicability and efficiency in real-world scenarios. Specifically, the objective was to create a functional prototype of an application for sharing recipes. Using AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, the team evaluated the capabilities of these systems across the various phases of software development, from ideation to deployment.

                <!-- Actions Section -->
                <h2>Actions</h2>
                <p>
                    To begin, the team defined the requirements for the application and used generative AI tools to assist in brainstorming potential features. ChatGPT helped in drafting user stories, while Claude provided guidance on the structure of the database. Gemini was utilized for generating code snippets and debugging issues during development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The process included several iterative steps:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Generating initial wireframes and designs for the app's user interface using AI suggestions.</li>
                        <li>Developing key features, such as user authentication, recipe uploading, and browsing functionality, with AI assistance.</li>
                        <li>Testing and refining the generated code to ensure compatibility and performance.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges were encountered during the project, particularly in refining prompts to generate accurate and relevant results from the AI tools. The team worked through multiple iterations, improving the quality of the outputs by experimenting with different prompt structures and combining the strengths of each tool.

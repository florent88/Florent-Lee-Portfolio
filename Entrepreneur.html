				<!-- Problem Section -->
				<h2>Problem</h2>
				<p>
					As a final project for a semester-long class, we were tasked with designing our own startup from scratch, which included developing a business model, selecting a subcontracting company, and managing the pricing and logistics of the entire operation. Once the project was assigned, the next three weeks became extremely busy for us due to overlapping exams. As double diploma students, our schedules were much more demanding compared to our classmates, whose exams were scheduled later. Unfortunately, this created significant disruptions in our ability to manage the project efficiently, making it particularly challenging to stay on track and complete it on time.

				<h2>Goal/Key Metrics</h2>
				<p>
					The project accounted for over half of the course’s total grade, making it critical for us to achieve the highest possible score. Our objectives included delivering a polished and professional presentation, meeting the professor’s expectations, and, as a personal goal, impressing our classmates with the quality of our work.

				<!-- Actions Section -->
				<h2>Actions</h2>
				<p>
					After a week of little progress, I took the initiative to schedule a meeting with my teammates. During the meeting, we collectively decided on a product or service to present, ensuring that everyone was on board with the idea. I then outlined the key steps needed for the presentation and divided the workload into equal parts for maximum efficiency. To ensure fairness and satisfaction, we held a vote on who would handle each section, allowing everyone to choose a role they felt comfortable with. This approach allowed each teammate to work at their own pace, avoiding the need for frequent meetings or other potentially time-consuming activities during a hectic exam period.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the project neared completion, only the PowerPoint presentation remained. However, with more exams looming, it became difficult to divide this task among the team. Since I was already ahead in both grades and my exam preparations, I volunteered to take on the task myself. I created a PowerPoint presentation that my teammates and I were proud of, and we all felt it represented our work excellently.
